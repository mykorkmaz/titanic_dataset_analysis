Repository for Titanic dataset analysis project, exploring factors that influenced survival rates using machine learning models
#### Titanic Dataset Analysis
This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers on the Titanic's maiden voyage, and to build a predictive model to determine if a passenger survived or not.

### Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 891 observations and 12 variables, including passenger class, age, gender, and fare. There are missing values in the age, cabin, and embarked variables, which have been imputed or dropped during the analysis.

### Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights about the dataset and to visualize the relationships between variables. The analysis revealed that survival rates were higher for women, children, and first-class passengers.

Several machine learning models were trained to predict survival using various features, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and support vector machines. The random forest model achieved the highest accuracy, with an AUC-ROC score of 0.8637.

### Conclusion
The Titanic dataset provides a fascinating glimpse into the lives of passengers on the Titanic's maiden voyage, and analyzing it provides valuable insights into factors that influenced survival rates. The analysis also demonstrates the usefulness of machine learning models in predicting outcomes based on available data.

### Future Work
Future work could include exploring other features or combinations of features that may be predictive of survival, as well as testing the model on new datasets to assess its generalizability.
